= Connecting to REST APIs

In an integration, to connect to a REST API, you must have created a
connector for that API by uploading an OpenAPI specification that
describes the API. See 
{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}#adding-api-connectors[{NameOfFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}, Adding  REST API client connectors].

When a connector for the REST API you want to connect to
is available in {prodname},
the steps for connecting to that REST API are:

* <<register-with-rest-api>> if required
* <<create-rest-api-connection>>
* <<add-api-client-connection>>
