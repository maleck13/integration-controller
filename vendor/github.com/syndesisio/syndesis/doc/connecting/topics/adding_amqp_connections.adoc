= Add an AMQP connection to an integration

You must create an AMQP connection before you can add an
AMQP connection to an
integration. If you did not already create an AMQP connection, 
see <<create-amqp-connection>>. 

The procedure for adding an AMQP connection to an integration varies
according to whether you want to use the connection to start an
integration, finish an integration, or publish messages in the middle
of an integration.
