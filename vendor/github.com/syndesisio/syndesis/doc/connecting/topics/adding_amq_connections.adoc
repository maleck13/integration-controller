= Add an AMQ connection to an integration

You must create an AMQ connection before you can add it to an
integration. If you did not already create an AMQ connection, 
see <<create-amq-connection>>. 

The procedure for adding an AMQ connection to an integration varies
according to whether you want to use the AMQ connection to start
the integration, finish the integration, or publish messages in the
middle of an integration.
