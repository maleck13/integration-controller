= Add an MQTT connection to an integration

You must create an MQTT connection before you can add it to an
integration. If you did not already create an MQTT connection, 
see <<creating-mqtt-connections>>. 

The procedure for adding an MQTT connection to an integration varies
according to whether you want to use the MQTT connection to 
obtain a message or publish a message.
