= Register {prodname} as a Gmail client application

To be able to connect to Gmail in an integration, 
you register your installation of {prodname} as a client application
that can access Gmail. Registration authorizes {prodname} to access Gmail.
With registration in place, you can create any number of Gmail 
connections and any number of 
integrations that connect to Gmail. While each Gmail connection uses the 
same registration, each connection can use different user credentials to 
access a different Gmail account. 

To authorize your {prodname} installation to access Gmail:

. In {prodname}, in the left navigation panel, click *Settings*. 
. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, 
click
image:shared/images/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to 
copy the callback URL for your installation of {prodname} to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL toward the end of this procedure. 
. In another browser tab, go to `https://console.developers.google.com` 
and do the following:
.. Confirm that you are signed in to the Gmail account that you want to
use to register {prodname} as a Gmail client application. 
Or, choose a different Gmail account and sign in to that account. 
.. Ensure that you want to use the current Google project to grant
authorization to {prodname}. Or, choose or create another project. 
If this Google account does not already
have a project, you must create one. For information about Google projects
and how you might want to organize your use of projects, click the Google help
icon in the upper right. 
.. You should see the *APIs and Services* dashboard. If you do not, then
in the upper left corner, click the
image:images/Hamburger.png[Navigation menu icon] and select
*APIs and Services* > *Dashboard*. 
.. Click the *Gmail API* card.
.. In the *Gmail API* page, click *Enable*. 
.. In the page that appears, in the left navigation panel, click 
*Credentials* and then click the *OAuth consent screen* tab. 
In this tab, do the following: 
... In the *Product name shown to users* field, enter a name for the 
client application. For example, enter `{prodname} client application`. 
... Skip the other fields. 
... Click *Save*. 
.. To the right of *Create Credentials*, click the down arrow to 
display a menu and select *OAuth client ID*. 
.. Select *Web application* and in the page that appears, do the following:
... In the *Name* field, enter a name for the OAuth client ID for 
your installation of {prodname}. This is different from the name that you 
entered for the client application itself. For example, enter 
`OAuth client ID for {prodname}`. 
... Skip *Authorized JavaScript origins*. 
... In the *Authorized redirect URIs* field, paste the callback URL 
that you copied from your {prodname} installation at the beginning of 
this procedure. 
... Click *Create* to display the client ID and client secret for your 
{prodname} installation. 
.. To the right of the client ID field, click
image:images/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client ID
to your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and in the Gmail *Client ID* field, 
paste the Gmail client ID that you just copied. 

. Return to the Google developers site and to the right of the 
client secret field, click 
image:images/copy_icon.png[the Copy icon] to copy the client secret to
your clipboard.

. Return to the {prodname} *Settings* page and in the 
Gmail *Client Secret* field, paste the Gmail client secret that you 
just copied. 
. Click *Save*. You should get a *Registration Successful!* notification. 	
. Click *Ok* to collapse the fields. With registration in place, you can
create a Gmail connection.
