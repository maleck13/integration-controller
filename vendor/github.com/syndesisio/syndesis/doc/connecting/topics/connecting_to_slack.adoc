= Connecting to Slack

In an integration, you can connect to an instance of Slack and deliver
a message to a particular user or to a channel. For example, this is
useful when an integration downloads a file from an FTP server and 
processes it in some way. You can finish an integration by 
notifying a Slack channel or user that the process was successful.

To connect to Slack in an integration, create a Slack 
connection. You can then add that same connection to any number of
integrations. Details are in the following topics:

* <<adding-slack-connections>>
