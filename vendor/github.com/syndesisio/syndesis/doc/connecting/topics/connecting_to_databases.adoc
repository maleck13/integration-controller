= Connecting to SQL databases

In an integration, you can connect to any of the following types of SQL
databases:

* Apache Derby
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL

You create a connection to the database that you want to access in an integration
and then you add that connection to an integration. 

To connect to other types of databases, you must upload a JDBC driver for
that database.
