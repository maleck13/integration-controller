= Start an integration by obtaining files from Dropbox

To start an integration by downloading files from Dropbox, 
add a Dropbox connection as the start connection:

. In the {prodname} panel on the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the Dropbox connection that
you want to use to start the integration. 
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the *Download* action
to obtain one or more files from the Dropbox account that this connection
accesses.
