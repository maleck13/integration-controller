= Add an Amazon S3 connection to an integration

You must create an Amazon S3 connection before you can add an
Amazon S3 connection to an
integration. If you did not already create an Amazon S3 connection,
see <<prerequisites-for-creating-s3-connection>>.

The procedure for adding an Amazon S3 connection to an integration varies
according to whether you want to use the S3 connection to start the 
integration, finish the integration, or access data in the middle of the
integration.
