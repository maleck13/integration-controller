= What to expect when using {prodname} for the first time

To use {prodname} on OpenShift Online, Red Hat provides a link.
Clicking this link displays the
*Red Hat OpenShift Online Log In* page, which prompts you to log in by
using your Red Hat account. Logging in prompts you to authorize
{prodname} to access to your account:

Click *Allow selected permissions*. You need to do this only once. The
next time you click the {prodname} access link, {prodname} immediately appears.

To use {prodname} on OpenShift Container Platform, follow the installation
instructions, which are at the end of 
{LinkFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}[{NameOfFuseOnlineIntegrationGuide}].

Red Hat supports using {prodname} in the following browsers:

* Chrome
