= Register {prodname} as a Salesforce client application

You must register your installation of {prodname} as a client application
that can access Salesforce.
This lets you create any number of integrations that connect
to Salesforce. In other words, you need to register a particular 
installation of {prodname} with Salesforce only once.

ifeval::["{context}" == "t2sf"]
If you already registered {prodname} as a Salesforce
client and created a Salesforce connection, skip to <<create-twitter-sf-integration>>.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{context}" == "sf2db"]
If you already registered {prodname} as a Salesforce
client and created a Salesforce connection, skip to  <<create-sf-db-integration>>.
endif::[]

In each {prodname} environment, there can be only one registration
of {prodname} as a Salesforce client. However, while each Salesforce 
connection uses the same registration, it can use different user
credentials. 

Perform these steps to register {prodname} as a Salesforce client application:

. In {prodname}:
.. In the left panel, click *Settings*.
.. On the *Settings* page, near the top, to the right of the callback URL, 
click 
image:images/CopyCallback.png[Copy Callback URL] to 
copy the callback URL for your installation of {prodname} to the clipboard. 
You will need this URL toward the end of this procedure. 
.. To the right of the *Salesforce* entry,
click *Register* to display the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields.
. In another browser tab, log in to your Salesforce account and
follow the steps below to create a connected app.
These instructions assume that you are
using the Salesforce Classic user interface. To switch from the
Salesforce Lightning Experience interface, click your profile icon and select
*Switch to Salesforce Classic*.
For additional information, see the Salesforce documentation for
https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_create.htm[Create a Connected App].
.. In Salesforce, in the upper right, click *Setup*.
.. In the left panel, select *Build* > *Create* > *Apps*.
.. Scroll down to *Connected Apps* and click *New*.
.. Enter the required information and then select *Enable OAuth Settings*.
.. In the *Callback URL* field, paste your
{prodname} URL, which you copied at the beginning of this procedure.
For example:
`\https://app-proj9128.7b63.{prodnameinurl}.openshiftapps.com/api/v1/credentials/callback`.
.. For *OAuth Scopes*, add:
** *Access and manage your data (api)*
** *Allow access to your unique identifier (openid)*
** *Perform requests on your behalf at any time (refresh_token, offline_accesss)*
.. Select *Configure ID token* and then *Include Standard Claims*.
.. Scroll down and click *Save*.
.. Scroll up to see that Salesforce indicates a short wait:

.. Click *Continue*.
.. Copy the consumer key that Salesforce provides.
. Return to your {prodname} installation *Settings* page and paste the
Salesforce-provided
consumer key into the Salesforce *Client ID* field.
. Back in Salesforce, copy the consumer secret that Salesforce provides.
. Return to your {prodname} installation *Settings* page and paste the
Salesforce-provided consumer secret into the Salesforce
*Client Secret* field.
. Click *Save* and then click *Ok*.
