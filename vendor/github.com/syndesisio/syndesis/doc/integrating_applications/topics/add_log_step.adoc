= Adding a log step

{prodname} provides log information for each integration version that
it executes. To learn what information is automatically logged,
see <<viewing-log-information>>.

To log additional information between any two steps, add a log step to the
integration. For each message that it receives, a log step can provide
one or more of the following:

* The message's header, which provides metadata about the message.
* The message's body, which provides the content of the message.
* Text that you specify either explicitly or through evaluation of an 
http://camel.apache.org/simple.html[Apache Camel Simple language] expression. 

To add a log step, you must be creating a new integration or
editing an integration. The integration must already have
its start and finish connections.

To add a log step:

. In the integration visualization panel on the left, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign]
at the location where you want to add a log step.
. In the popup, click *Add a Step*.
. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Log*.
. On the *Configure Log Step* page, select the content that you want
to log. If you select *Custom text*, then in the text input field, 
enter one of the following:
* The text that you want to log
* A Camel Simple language expression

+
If you enter an expression, {prodname} resolves the 
expression and logs the resulting text. 
. When log step configuration is complete, click *Done* to add the step
to the integration. 
. When the integration is complete, publish it to start seeing output
from the new log step.

After an integration that has a log step has been executed, output from
its log step appears in the integration's *Activity* tab. See
<<viewing-log-information>>.
