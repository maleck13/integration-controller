= Stopping integrations

Each integration can have exactly one version that is running. A running
version is in the *Running* state. To stop
running an integration:

. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the list of integrations, identify the entry for the integration that you
want to stop running. The entry shows that this integration is *Running*.
. At the far right of this integration's entry, click
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab]
and select *Stop*.

{prodname} stops running the integration. *Stopping* and then
*Stopped* appears in the
integration's entry in the list of integrations.
