[id='about-actions']
= About actions performed by connections

In an integration, each connection performs one action. As you create an
integration, you choose a connection to add to the integration and then you
choose the action that the connection performs. For example, when you
create an integration that uses a Salesforce connection, you choose from
a set of actions that includes, but is not limited to,
creating a Salesforce account, updating a Salesforce account, and
searching Salesforce.

Some actions require additional configuration and {prodname}
prompts you for this information if it is needed.
