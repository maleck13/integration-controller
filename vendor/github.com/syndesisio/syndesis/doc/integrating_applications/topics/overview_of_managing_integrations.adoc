= Overview of managing integrations

Each {prodname} environment is hosted on OpenShift Online or
OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). A common set up is to have
a {prodname} development environment, a {prodname} test environment, 
and a {prodname} deployment environment. 

To facilitate this, {prodname} provides the ability to export an 
integration from one {prodname} environment and then import that integration
into another {prodname} environment. 

The information and procedures for managing integrations are the same
in each kind of {prodname} environment, unless specifically noted.
