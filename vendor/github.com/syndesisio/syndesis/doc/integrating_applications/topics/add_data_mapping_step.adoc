= Adding a data mapping step

You can add a step to an integration to map data from the previous
connection(s) and any other steps to the next connection. For example,
suppose the integration data contains a `Name` field and the next
connection in the integration has a `CustomerName` field. You need to
map the source `Name` field to the target `CustomerName` field.

When you add a data mapper step you might be creating a new integration or editing
an integration. The flow of the integration appears in the left panel.

To add a data mapper step:

. In the left panel, where you want to add a data mapper step,
hover over the image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign'].
. In the popup that appears, click *Add a Step*.
. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Data Mapper* to display source
and target fields. 

For details about configuring the data mapping step, see  <<mapping-data>>.
