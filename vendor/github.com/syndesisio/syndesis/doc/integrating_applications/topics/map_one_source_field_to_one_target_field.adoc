= Mapping one source field to one target field

The default mapping behavior maps one source field to one target field.
To do this:

. In the *Sources* panel, click the data field you want to map from.

You
might need to expand an integration step to see the data fields that it
provides.
+
When there are many source fields, you can search for the
field of interest by clicking the
image:shared/images/magnifying-glass.png[Magnifying Glass] and entering
the name of the data field in the search field.
. In the *Target* panel, click the data field you want to map to.

The data mapper displays a line that connects the two fields that you just
selected.

To confirm that the mapping is defined, in the upper right, click
image:shared/images/grid.png[Grid] to display the defined mappings.
Click image:shared/images/grid.png[Grid] again to display the data field
panels.

Here is another way to map a single source field to a single target
field:

. In the *Configure Mapper* page, in the upper right, click the plus sign
to display the *Mapping Details* panel. 
. In the *Sources* section, enter
the name of the source field. 
. In the *Action* section, accept the
default *Map* action. 
. In the *Target* section, enter the name of the
field that you want to map to and click *Enter*.
