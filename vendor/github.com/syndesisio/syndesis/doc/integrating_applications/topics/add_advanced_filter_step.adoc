= Adding an advanced filter step

In a filter step, {prodname} inspects the
data and continues the integration only if the content meets
criteria that you define.
If the basic filter step does not let you
define the exact filter you need, then add an advanced filter step.

Add all connections to your integration before you add additional steps. When you
add a step, {prodname} operates on the data it receives from the
previous connections and any additional step(s).

When you add a step you might be creating a new integration or editing
an integration. The flow of the integration appears in the left panel.

To add an advanced filter step:

. In the left panel, where you want to add an advanced filter step to
the integration, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[title='plus sign']
and in the popup that appears, click *Add a Step*.

. Select *Advanced Filter*.

. In the edit box, use the
http://camel.apache.org/simple.html[Camel Simple Expression] language
to specify a filter
expression. For example, the following expression evaluates to true
when the message header's `type` field is set to `widget`:
+
----
${in.header.type} == 'widget' 
----
+
In the following example, the expression evaluates to true when the
body of the message contains a `title` field:
+
----
${in.body.title} 
----

. Click *Done* to add the advanced filter step to the integration.
