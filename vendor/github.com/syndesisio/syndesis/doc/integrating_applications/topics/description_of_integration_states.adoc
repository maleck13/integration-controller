= Description of integration states

{prodname} can maintain multiple versions of the same integration. 
The benefit of this is that you can edit an integration to change its
behavior. You do not need to create a new integration when something
changes. 

There can be exactly one draft version of an integration. 
{prodname} has a definition for the draft version of an integration but it 
has never run this version of the integration. When you edit an integration,
you are updating the draft version of the integration. 

In {prodname}, you can see a list of the versions of an integration in the 
integration's summary page. To view this page, in the left navigation
panel, click *Integrations* and then click the entry for the integration
whose versions you want to see. In the list of versions, each entry 
indicates the state of that version, which is one of the following:

|===
|*State*
|*Description*

|*Running*
|A *Running* version is executing; it is in service. Only one version
of an integration can be running. That is, only one
version at a time can be in the *Running* state.

|*Stopped*
|A *Stopped* version is not running. The draft version of an integration
is in the *Stopped* state. Each integration that was running at one time
and then stopped is in the *Stopped* state. 

If no version of this integration is in the *Running* state, 
then you can start a version that is stopped. 

|*Pending*
|A *pending* version is in transition. {prodname} is in the process
of either starting this version of the integration or stopping  
this version of the integration, but
the integration is not yet running or stopped. 

|*Error*
|An integration version that is in the *Error* state 
encountered an OpenShift error while being started or while running. 
The error suspended start-up or execution.  If this happens, try 
starting an earlier integration version that ran correctly. 
Alternatively, contact technical support for help. 
To do that, in any {prodname} page, in the upper right, click the 
image:shared/images/InfoIcon.png[title="Help"] icon and select *Support*.
