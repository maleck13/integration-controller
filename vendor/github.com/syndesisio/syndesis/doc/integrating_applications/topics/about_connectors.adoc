= About {prodname} connectors

{prodname} provides a set of connectors. A connector represents a specific
application that you want to obtain data from or send data to.
Each connector is a template
for creating a connection to that specific application. For example, you use the
Salesforce connector to create a connection to
Salesforce.

An application that you want to connect to might use the OAuth protocol
to authenticate users. In this case, you register {prodname} as a client
that can access that application. The registration is associated with the
connector. You need to register {prodname} only once with each 
application that uses OAuth. The registration extends to each 
connection that you create from that connector. 

If {prodname} does not provide a connector you need, a developer
can create the needed connector.
