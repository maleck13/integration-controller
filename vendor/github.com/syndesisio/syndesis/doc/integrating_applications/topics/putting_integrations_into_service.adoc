= Putting integrations into and out of service

After you create an integration, you can save it as a draft or 
start running it. The first time that you 
run an integration, {prodname} assembles the needed resources, 
builds the integration runtime, deploys the OpenShift pod that will
run the integration, and then starts executing the integration. 

At any time, you can click a button to stop running the integration. 
When you want to start the integration again, {prodname} already
has what it needs so starting it takes less time
than when you ran it for the first time. 

The process of starting an integration for the first time is 
referred to as publishing the integration. The following topics 
provide details:

* <<publishing-integrations>>
* <<stopping-integrations>>
* <<starting-integrations>>
* <<restarting-older-integration-versions>>
* <<troubleshooting-integration-execution>>
* <<copying-integrations-to-other-environments>>
