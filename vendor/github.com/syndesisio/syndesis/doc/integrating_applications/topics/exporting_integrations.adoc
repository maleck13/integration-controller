= Exporting integrations

When {prodname} exports an integration it downloads a zip file
to your local `Downloads` folder. This zip file
contains the information needed to recreate the integration in a
different {prodname} environment. 

To export an integration:

. In the left panel of {prodname}, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, identify the entry for the integration 
that you want to export.
. At the right of the entry, click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Three Vertical Dots] and
select *Export*. 

To import
the integration into another {prodname} environment, open that environment
and import the exported zip file. 

Exporting an integration is also a way to have a backup of the integration. 
However, {prodname} maintains the versions of an integration so exporting
an integration is not required for having a backup copy.
