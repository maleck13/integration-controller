= Publishing integrations

The first time that you run an integration you publish it.
Publishing an integration builds and deploys the integration runtime. 
The integration starts running. After publishing an integration, you can 
stop it and restart it. Exactly one version of an integration
can be running at one time. 

To run an integration for the first time, publish it by doing
one of the following:

* At the end of the procedure in which you create or edit the integration,
in the upper right, click *Publish*.

* Publish the draft version of an integration:
+
. In the left {prodname} panel, click *Integrations*.
. In the list of integrations, click the entry for the integration
that you want to publish. 
. On the integration's summary page, in the *Details* tab,
to the right of the draft entry, click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Three Vertical Dots] and
select *Publish*.

{prodname} displays the progress of the publication process, which has
several stages:

. *Assembling* creates pod resources needed to build the integration.
. *Building* gets the integration ready to deploy.
. *Deploying* waits for deployment of the pod that will run the integration.
. *Starting* waits for the pod to start running the integration. 
. *Deployed* indicates that the integration is running.

During start-up, you can click *View Logs* to display OpenShift logs that
provide start-up information. 

When publishing the integration is complete, the *Running* status appears next to
the integration name. The pod is running the integration.
