= Transforming target data

After you define a mapping, you can transform the data in the target
field to define how you want to store the date. For example, you
could specify the *Capitalize* transformation to ensure that the first
letter of a data value is uppercase.

To transform a target field:

. Create the mapping whose target you want to transform.
. In that mapping, click the target field you want to transform.
. In the *Mapping Details* panel, click *Add Transformation*.
. Click the down caret to display the list of transformations.
. Click the transformation you want to perform.
. If the transformation requires any input parameters, specify them
in the appropriate input fields.
