= Preparing to create an integration

Preparation for creating an integration starts with answers to the
questions listed in <<planning>>. After you have a plan for the
integration, you need to do the following before you can create the
integration:

. Determine whether an application that you want to connect to uses the
OAuth protocol. For each application that uses OAuth, register
{prodname} as a client that is authorized to access that application.
See <<obtaining-authorization-to-access-applications>>.

. Determine whether an application that you want to connect to uses
HTTP basic authentication. For each application that does, identify
the user name and password for accessing that application.
You need to provide this information when you
create the integration.

. For each application that you want to integrate, create a connection.
See <<about-creating-connections>>.
