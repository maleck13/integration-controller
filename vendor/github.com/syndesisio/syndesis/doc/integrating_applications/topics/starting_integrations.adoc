= Starting integrations

The first time that you start an integration, the process is
referred to as publishing the integration because {prodname} has to build
the integration runtime before it can run the integration. 
See <<publishing-integrations>>.

If you stop running an integration and then you want to start it again, the
steps are as follows:

. In the left navigation panel, click *Integrations*. 
. In the list of integrations, to the right of the entry for the
integration that you want to start, click  
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Kebab] and select *Start*. 

{prodname} displays *Starting* as the status of that integration version, 
and then *Running* when the integration is running again.
