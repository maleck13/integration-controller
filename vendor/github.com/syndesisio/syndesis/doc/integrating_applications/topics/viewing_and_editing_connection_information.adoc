= Viewing and editing connection information

After you create a connection, {prodname} assigns an internal identifier to
the connection. This identifier does not change. You can
change the connection's name, description, or configuration values and
{prodname} recognizes it as the same connection.

There are two ways to view and edit information about a connection:

* In the left panel, click *Connections* and then click any connection to
view its details.

* In the left panel, click *Integrations* and then click any integration
to view its details. In the *Integration Summary* page, in the flow diagram
of the integration, click a
connection icon to view that connection's details.

On the *Connection Details* page, for the connection you want to edit, click
image:images/PencilForEditing.png[Edit] next to a field to edit that field.
Or, for some connections, below the configuration fields, click *Edit* to
change configuration values. If you change any values, be sure to click
*Save*.

If you update a connection that is used in an integration that is running,
you must republish the integration by stopping it and starting it again.

For connections to applications that use the OAuth protocol to authorize
access, you cannot change the login credentials that the connection uses.
To connect to the application and use different login credentials, you
must create a new connection.
