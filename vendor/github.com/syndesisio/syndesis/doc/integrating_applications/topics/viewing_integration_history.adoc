= Viewing integration history

To view a list of the versions of an integration:

. In the left panel, click *Integrations* to display a list of the
integrations in your environment.
. Click the entry for the integration whose versions you want to see.

In the page that appears, the *History* section lists the versions
of the integration. The
image:shared/images/GreenCircleCheckmark.png[Current Version] icon
identifies the current version, which is the most recently,
successfully running version.
For each version, you can also see the date on which it was last started.

To edit, start, or stop a particular version, click the

version's entry. Select the operation you want to perform.
