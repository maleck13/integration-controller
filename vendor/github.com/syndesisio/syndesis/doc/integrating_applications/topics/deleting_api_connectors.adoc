= Deleting API client connectors

You cannot delete a connector when there is a connection that was 
created from that connector and this connection is being used in 
an integration. After you delete an API client connector, 
you cannot use a connection that was created from that 
connector.

To delete an API client connector:

. In the left panel, click *Customizations*. 
. In the *API Client Connectors* tab, to the right of the name of the 
connector that you want to delete, click *Delete*. 
. Read the confirmation popup to be sure that you want to click *Delete*.
