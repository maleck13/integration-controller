= Testing integrations

After you create an integration and it is running correctly in a
development environment, you might want to run it in a different
environment to test it.

To test an integration in a different {prodname} environment:

. See <<about-copying-integrations>>.

. Export the integration from the development environment. See
<<exporting-integrations>>.

. Import the integration into the test environment. See
<<importing-integrations>>.
