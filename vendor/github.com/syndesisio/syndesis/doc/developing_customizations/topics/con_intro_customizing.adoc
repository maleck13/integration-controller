= Introduction to developing {prodname} customizations

Connectors form the foundation of {prodname}. Each connector
is an Apache Camel component with added metadata that
enables the intuitive {prodname} interface. This metadata
specifies:

* Some connection settings

* Actions that can be performed and their
properties and defaults

* What the input data and output data look like

Each connector

* Has a single purpose, for example, connect to a
Salesforce application

* Hides component properties that are not relevant to that purpose

When an integration of different applications is ready to be deployed:

. {prodname} creates a Spring Boot-based Camel project and a
build configuration.

. Triggers the build, which produces a container image.

. Starts running the container image on OpenShift.

In addition, {prodname} stores your integrationâ€™s implementation
source code and configuration in a source control management system,
such as GitHub. This enables you to look at it, change it and
include it as a part of your DevOps pipeline.
