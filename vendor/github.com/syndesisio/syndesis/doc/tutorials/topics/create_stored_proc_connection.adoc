A stored procedure connection lets {prodname} connect to a SQL
database. When you add a stored procedure connection to
an integration, you select the stored procedure that you
want the integration to run.

To create a stored procedure
connection:

. In the left panel, click *Connections* to display available connections.
. In the upper right, click *Create Connection* to display
{prodname} connection types.
. Click the *SQL Stored Procedure* connection type.
. Configure the connection as follows:
.. In the *Password* field, enter the password to use to connect to
the database.
+
To obtain the password for connecting to the sample
database provided with {prodname}, invoke the following
command:
+
`oc get dc syndesis-db -o yaml | grep -A 1 POSTGRESQL_SAMPLEDB_PASSWORD`

.. In the *Connection URL* field, to use the sample database provided
with {prodname}, enter `*???????*`. Or, enter the URL for your own
database.
.. In the *Username* field, to use the sample database provided
with {prodname}, enter `*???????*`. Or, enter the account name for
connecting to your own database.
.. Click *Next*.
. In the *Connection Name* field, enter `*EBS Connect 1*`.
. In the *Description* field, enter `*Connection for accessing an
Oracle EBS database in a sample integration.*`
. In the upper right, click *Create* to see that the
*EBS Connect 1* connection is now available for use in an integration.
