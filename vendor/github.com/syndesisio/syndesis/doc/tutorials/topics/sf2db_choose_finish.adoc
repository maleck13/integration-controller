= Choose the finish connection

To add the finish connection to the integration:

. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page,
click the  *PostgresDB* connection.
This integration finishes by using the credentials
defined in this database connection to connect to the
provided sample database.

. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Invoke SQL stored procedure*,
which passes data to a stored procedure.

. In the *Procedure Name* field, click and select *add_lead*, which is the
provided stored procedure to run in the sample database.
The selected procedure determines the requirements for additional
steps in the integration, for example, which Salesforce data fields
need to be mapped to which database fields.

. Click *Done* to add the finish connection to the integration.
