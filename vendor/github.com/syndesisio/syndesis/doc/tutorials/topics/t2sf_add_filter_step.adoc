= Add a basic filter step

Add a basic filter step that checks tweets that mention you
for particular content. The integration
continues only if that content is present.

To add a basic filter step:

. In the main panel, click *Add a step*.
. Click *Basic Filter*.

. In the first field (*The data you want to evaluate*), start to enter 
`*text*` and when `text`
appears below the field, click it. This indicates that the content to
filter for is in the Twitter `text` field, which contains the text of the tweet.

. Accept *contains* as the condition to be met for the integration to
continue.
. In the last field, enter `*#RedHatIsGreat*` or some other text you choose.
A tweet that mentions you must contain the text you enter here for
the integration to continue operating on this data.
. Click *Done* to complete the basic filter step.
