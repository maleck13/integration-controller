= Add a data mapping step

Add a data mapping step that correlates the `task` field in the
output from the damage reporter step to the `task` field in the
database that the REST API accesses:

. In the left panel, hover over the plus sign between the damage reporter
step and the finish connection to display a pop-up in which
you click *Add a Step*.
. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Data Mapper*. In the data mapper,
the *Sources* panel on the left displays the fields in the
output from the damage reporter step. The
*Target* panel on the right displays the fields in the database that
the API accesses.
. In the *Sources* panel, click the `task` field.
. In the *Target* panel, expand the `body` field and click `task`.
. Click *Done*.
