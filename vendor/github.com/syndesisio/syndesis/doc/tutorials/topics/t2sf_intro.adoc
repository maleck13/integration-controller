= Implement a Twitter to Salesforce sample integration

:context: t2sf
This sample integration watches Twitter for tweets that mention
a particular Twitter user. When the integration finds such tweets,
it filters
them so that only those tweets that contain the text you specify cause
the integration to continue.

For tweets that contain the specified text, the integration passes
data related to the tweet, including the Twitter user name, to Salesforce
and Salesforce creates a new contact.

To implement, deploy, and test this sample integration, the main steps are:

. <<register-with-twitter>>
. <<create-twitter-connection>>
. <<register-with-salesforce_{context}>>
. <<create-salesforce-connection_{context}>>
. <<create-twitter-sf-integration>>
. <<t2sf-confirm-working>>
. <<cleanup_{context}>>

Before you implement this sample integration,
see <<t2sf-prerequisites>>.
