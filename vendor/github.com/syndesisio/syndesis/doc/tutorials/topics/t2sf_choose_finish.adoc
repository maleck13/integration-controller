= Choose the finish connection

To add the finish connection to the integration:

. On the *Choose a Finish Connection* page, click the Salesforce
connection you created. If you gave it the example name, you
would click *SF Connect 1*.
This integration finishes by using the credentials
defined in this connection to connect to Salesforce.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *New record*.
. On the next page, accept *Contact* as the
Salesforce record to create.
. Click  *Done* to add the finish
connection to the integration.
//. On the next page, enter `*TwitterScreenName__c*` as the field
//that holds the identifying value. The
//connection uses the value in this custom field to determine
//whether creation of
//a Salesforce contact record is required. If a Salesforce contact record
//with this ID already exists then the integration updates that record.
//Otherwise, the integration creates a contact record.
