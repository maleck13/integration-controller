= Choose the start connection

To choose the start connection:

. On the left, click *Integrations*.
. In the upper right, click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click the Twitter connection
you created. If you gave it the example name, you would
click *Twitter Connect 1*.
When the integration starts, it uses the credentials defined in
this connection to connect to Twitter.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Mention*.

After
connecting to Twitter, the integration monitors Twitter for mentions
that include your Twitter screen name. A match triggers the
next step in the integration. However, before you add steps that operate
on data between connections,
you choose the connection that the integration uses to finish its work.
