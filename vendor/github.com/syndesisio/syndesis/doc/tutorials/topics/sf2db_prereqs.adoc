= Prerequisites for implementing Salesforce to database integration

To implement a Salesforce to database sample integration,
you need an account in a Salesforce installation that is used for development.
This account must have Salesforce API access, which is available in a
Salesforce Enterprise account or a Salesforce Developer account. To obtain
