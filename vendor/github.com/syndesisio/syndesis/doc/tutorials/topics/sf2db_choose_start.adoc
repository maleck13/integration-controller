= Choose the start connection

To choose the start connection:

. On the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click your
Salesforce connection. If you specified the example name,
you would click *SF Connect 1*.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *On create*.
. In the *Object name* field, select *Lead*.
. Click *Done* to add the start connection to the integration.

After connecting to Salesforce, the integration watches for
notifications that a Salesforce *Lead*
record was created.
When the integration finds such a notification, it passes the new
lead's data to the next step in the integration.

However, before you can add the next step, you must choose the
integration's finish connection.
