= Choose the start connection

To choose the start connection:

. On the left, click *Integrations*.
. Click *Create Integration*.
. On the *Choose a Start Connection* page, click your
AMQ connection. If you specified the example name,
you would click *AMQ Broker 1*.
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click the *Subscribe for Messages* action
to receive messages from the queue you specify.
. In the *Destination Name* field, enter `*inventoryReceived*` for
the name of the queue to obtain data from.
. Click in the *Destination Type* field and select *Queue*.
. Leave the other fields blank.
. Click *Done* to add the start connection to the integration.

After connecting to AMQ, the integration watches for
messages on the `inventoryReceived` queue. When a message is available,
the integration passes it to the *Damage Reporter* step.
However, before you can add that step to the integration, you must choose the
integration's finish connection.
